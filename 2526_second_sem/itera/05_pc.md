## Goals

Computers are infinitely complex, and each individual component is a field of study in and of itself.

Instead of going over every component in detail, we'll:
1. Cover the basics of how they function 
2. Contribute to the overall system
3. Talk about standards, performance, compatibility, and other consumer-facing topics

# Central Processing Unit

---

## CPU

The "brain" of the computer

---

## Main Consumer Question

"Can this do what I need?"

---

## Architecture and Generations

The way a computer works depends on it's architecture, think of [analogy here]

Note that when buying processor, newer generations are always preferred

---

## Intel and AMD

The two primary CPU manufacturers

Naming scheme here

---

## A note on ARM and Apple Silicon

Uses a different architecture, so applications can't be cross platform,

generall more efficient compared to processors, but less flexible

---

## A note on Gigahertz (GHz)

A flawed metric which isn't as important as things like core count generation

# Motherboard

---

## Motherboard

The [analogy]

---

## Main Consumer Question

"Does this support my cpu, and is it the correct size"

---

## Architecture

certain motherboards only support certain cpus

---

## Form Factors

Sizing

---

## Features

wifi, bluetooth, m.2, ram slots

# Graphics Processing Unit

---

## Graphics Processing Unit

Deals with graphics

---

## Main Consumer Question

Does this do what I need?

---

## Graphics Processing Unit vs Graphics Card

many cpus have in build gpu, graphics cards are more efficient

---

## A note on integrated vs dedicated graphics

Often, it's fine to have intergrated especially in the modern day


---

## NVIDIA and AMD and Intel

3 main manufacturers

# Power Supply Unit

---

## Power Supply Unit

supplies pwore

---

## Main Consumer Question

does this have enough wattage

---

## Wattage

how much power the psu can supply

---

## Rating and Efficiency

how efficient and reliable it is

---

## THE TIER LIST

# Random Access Memory

---

## Random Access Memory

usually called main memry

---

## Main Consumer Question

is it enough

---

## Generation

determined by motherboard

---

## Capacity

depends on use case, 16 is good

---

## Speed

not something that matters unless you have a specific use case, fast is better though

---

## A note on Dual Channel

buy two sticks if possible

---

## A note on SO-DIMM and DIMM

sodimss for laptop

---

# Storage

---

## Storage

main way to store things

---

## Main Consumer Question

is it enough

---

## Types of Storage

hdd
sdd
nvme

---

## Speed vs Capacity vs Price

you kinda have to pick one

---

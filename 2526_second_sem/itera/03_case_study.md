## A question

Have you sent a physical letter through the post office recently?

## The postal service

The concept of sending information over a distance predates modern technology by thousands of years.

Phiedippides, a Greek *messenger*

- is said to have run from Marathon to Athens (about 26 miles) to deliver news of a military victory in 490 BC.

Since the dawn of civilization, humans have realized that

> I need to be able to talk to people who are far away.

One of the oldest known mentions being in ancient Egypt around 2000 BC.

# Goals
1. Understand ICT through a familiar example
2. See how changes in technology affect communication
3. See the impact of the development of ICT

## Systematization of the postal service

China, even before it's unification, was an incredibly large set of territories.

<img class="mx-auto rounded w-1/3" src="./images/03/chinese_couriers.jpg"/>

And so a more organized postal system was needed and created, with the first mentions dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties (1600-256 BC).

This included an **upgrade** in hardware, software, and network that allowed for more efficient communication.

## ICT as a Requirement

::left::

::right::

Larger empires and nations **required** communication systems to maintain control.

Rome, at around the fifth century, conquered a huge area around the Mediterranean, 

> and so they developed the *cursus publicus*, a state-run courier and transportation service.

And at its peak, there were claims that it could cover 270 kilometers in 24 hours, roughly the distance between Butuan and Cebu

---

## Adoption and Survival

In the west, the *cursus publicus* survived the fall of the Roman Empire

Almost every kingdom that rose after it adopted some form of the system.

And to this day, we still have a *government-run* postal service

<img class="mx-auto rounded w-1/3" src="./images/03/philpost.jpg"/>

at 2021, there were still at least 99 million letters being sent through domestically

---

## A large upgrade in hardware and its impact

In the early decades of the 20th century, **planes** started existing.

And for the first time in human history, you could send information across the world in a matter of **days**.

And even before then, **train** systems allowed for much faster communication across large landmasses.

# Which of the components of ICT did not change?

---

## A change in systems

The telegraph was invented in the early 19th century, and was used to send messages across long distances using electrical signals.

It was **instantaneous**, but had significantly higher costs, required specialized hardware and knowledge to use, and wasn't available to the general public.

## Building infrastructure

The telegraph required a vast **network of wires** and relay stations to transmit messages over long distances.

And so the *infrastructure for the infrastructure* had to be built from scratch. Knowledge of electricity, engineering, logistics.

> How to place wires across the ocean

And while the telegraph is now obsolete, it laid the groundwork for future technologies and is the backbone of modern communication systems.

## Quantity as a different quality

A large amount of something can fundamentally change its nature or impact

The difference between a car with 300 horsepower and a car with 3000 horsepower 

> is not just speed

## A glimpse of the present

> Do you get earthquake notifications on your phone? 

The speed of modern ICT systems are so much faster than traditional systems that they affect the world fundamentally differently.

- It's not just asking your boss for directions, it's giving real-time updates during emergencies.
- Press conferences live streamed minutes after a scandal
- It's videos reaching billions of people in hours

# Dictionaries
key value stores, hash maps

---

## Dictionary

A dictionary is a **key-value** store. It's primary use case is

1. Storing multiple pieces of data
2. Accessing data with keys instead of indices

A dictionary is *mutable* and *unordered*.

- In python it's defined using curly braces`{}`
- Where each key is separated from its value by a colon `:` 
- and each key-value pair is separated by a comma `,`

```python 
my_dictionary = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

## Example problem

What if we wanted to store the health of different enemies in the game

With lists one way of doing this is
```python
enemies = ["goblin", "troll", "dragon"]
```
```python
health = [30, 50, 100]
```

How would you access the health of the troll?
```python
for i in range(len(___)):
    if ___[i] == "___":
        print(___[i])
```

---

## Example problem

What if we wanted to add a new value for `"orc"` with health `40`

```python
enemies.append("orc")
health.append(40)
```

And if wanted to delete the `"goblin"`

```python
index = enemies.index("goblin")
enemies.pop(index)
health.pop(index)
```

---

## Exercise

Given
```python
enemies = ["goblin", "troll", "dragon"]
weight = [30, 50, 100]
```

Write a function where
```python
def get_weight(enemy_name):
    """
    input: enemy_name (String)
    return: weight (int)
    """
```

---

## Dictionary solution

```python
enemy_health = {
    "goblin": 30,
    "troll": 50,
    "dragon": 100
}
```

```python
enemy_health["troll"]
```

## Hashing

Dictionaries work by using a process called *hashing*

Recall that lists are stored in **straight** blocks of memory. That is why lists are ordered, and why indices start at 0

A dictionary uses a **hash function** to convert the key into a memory address

And when a key is looked up, the hash function is used again to find the memory address
